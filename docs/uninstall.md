#### Uninstalling OpenFunction with a specify runtime

```shell
fn uninstall --async
```

or

```shell
fn uninstall --sync
```

#### Support users in China to uninstall

> This only makes sense when you have installed OpenFunction (and its dependencies) with the `--region-cn` parameter.

```shell
fn uninstall --region-cn --all
```

```shell
fn uninstall --version latest
```
