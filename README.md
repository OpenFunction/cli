# ![OpenFunctionCtl](docs/images/logo.png)

`cli` is the CLI for [OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction)

The `cli` repo is used to track issues for the `OpenFunction`.  this tool allows users to focus on the core functionality of the OpenFunction, while also presenting the relationship between the OpenFunction and its dependent components in a more abstract and friendly way to the user.

## Main commands
The main commands supported by the CLI are:
- init: provides management for openfunctionâ€™s framework.
- install: install OpenFunction and its dependencies.
- uninstall: uninstall OpenFunction and its dependencies.
- create: create a function from a file or stdin.
- apply: apply a function from a file or stdin.
- get: prints a table of the most important information about the specified function.
  - get builder: prints important information about the builder.
  - get serving:prints important information about the serving.
- delete: delete a specified the function.

## Getting started

#### Build OpenFunction CLI

You can use `make build` to build the OpenFunction CLI â€”â€” `fn`.
When the command is executed, you can find the artifact in the `. /dist` directory.
Move it to the appropriate path in the `PATH` so that you can use it in your environment.

```shell
~# make build
go fmt ./...
/opt/openfunction/fn-cli/bin/goimports -w cmd/ pkg/ testdata/
go vet ./...
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build  -ldflags "-s -w -X 'main.goversion=go version go1.16.7 linux/amd64'" \
-o ./dist/fn_linux_amd64 cmd/main.go;
```

### Use `fn` to deploy OpenFunction

> We assume that you have placed the artifacts from the above step under the appropriate path in `PATH` and renamed it `fn`. 

You can use the `fn install --all` to complete a simple deployment. By default, this command will install the *v0.4.0* version of OpenFunction for you, while it will skip the installation process for components that already exist in the cluster (you can use the `--upgrade` command to overwrite these components).

Please refer to the [fn install docs](docs/install.md).

```shell
# fn install --all --upgrade
Start installing OpenFunction and its dependencies.
Here are the components and corresponding versions to be installed for this installation:
+------------------+---------+
| COMPONENT        | VERSION |
+------------------+---------+
| Keda             | 2.4.0   |
| Knative Serving  | 0.26.0  |
| Cert Manager     | v1.5.4  |
| Ingress Nginx    | 1.1.0   |
| Tekton Pipelines | v0.28.1 |
| Shipwright       | 0.6.0   |
| OpenFunction     | v0.4.0  |
| Dapr             | 1.4.3   |
+------------------+---------+
The following components already exist in the current cluster:
+------------------+---------+
| COMPONENT        | VERSION |
+------------------+---------+
| Keda             |         |
| Knative Serving  |         |
| Ingress Nginx    |         |
| Cert Manager     |         |
| Tekton Pipelines |         |
| Dapr             |         |
+------------------+---------+
You can see the list of components to be installed and the list of components already exist in the cluster.
You have used the `--upgrade` parameter, which means that the installation process will overwrite the components that already exist in the cluster.
Make sure you know what happens when you do this.

### Use `fn` to uninstall OpenFunction

> We assume that you have placed the artifacts from the above step under the appropriate path in `PATH` and renamed it `fn`. 

You can use `fn uninstall --all` to easily uninstall OpenFunction and its dependencies (or just uninstall OpenFunction without arguments).

Please refer to the [fn uninstall docs](docs/uninstall.md).

```shell
~# fn uninstall --all
Start uninstalling OpenFunction and its dependencies.
Here are the components and corresponding versions to be uninstalled for this installation:
+------------------+---------+
| COMPONENT        | VERSION |
+------------------+---------+
| Cert Manager     | v1.5.4  |
| Ingress Nginx    | 1.1.0   |
| Tekton Pipelines | v0.28.1 |
| Shipwright       | 0.6.0   |
| OpenFunction     | v0.4.0  |
| Dapr             | 1.4.3   |
| Keda             | 2.4.0   |
| Knative Serving  | 0.26.0  |
+------------------+---------+
You can see the list of components to be installed and the list of components already exist in the cluster.
You have used the `--upgrade` parameter, which means that the installation process will overwrite the components that already exist in the cluster.
